  description: 'Ridge Gives Back is a day of service in which every student and staff member at Ridge High School spends the day engaged in service activities of their choice.  Activities will include trips to charitable associations in the communities surrounding the school, as well as the creation of materials in school that will then be shipped or delivered to nonprofit organizations (e.g., breakfast bags for local soup kitchens).  It is our hope that we can provide a chance for each individual to experience a day strictly for the sake of giving and examine how it makes them feel, what they need (and donâ€™t need) in order to make a difference, and why they might incorporate more intentional altruism into their daily lives.',
